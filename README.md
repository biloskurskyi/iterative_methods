Iterative methods of solving nonlinear equations and and systems

Examples of solving the equation f(x)=0 using the following methods:  
chord method, tangent method (Newton's method), combined method of chords and tangents.  
Also provided is an example of the iterative method for solving a system of equations using Newton's method.   
It is recommended to run the code in a Jupyter Notebook in the appropriate blocks.
